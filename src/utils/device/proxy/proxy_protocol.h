/*
 * The wire contract between GPU device code and the host-side CPU proxy.
 *
 * This header is installed and compiled into user device code, so the host
 * runtime and a user's kernels can be built at different times against
 * different versions of it. The rules that keep that safe:
 *
 *   - Frozen except additively. Never reorder or retype an existing field.
 *     New data goes in `flags`, in `reserved`, or behind a new opcode. Every
 *     shared struct carries a size assert below; if one fires, the change
 *     under it is an ABI break, not a compile error to be silenced.
 *
 *   - Plain C++ only. No CUDA includes and no std::atomic members. Device
 *     code reaches these fields through cuda::atomic views and host code
 *     through __atomic builtins; making a member atomic would change the
 *     layout and break device compilation.
 *
 *   - Nothing backend-specific ever enters the ring. A submission names
 *     memory views by id and offset; the backend's own handles are resolved
 *     host-side, after the record is dequeued.
 *
 * Bump kProxyProtocolVersion whenever an additive change still needs old
 * device code to be rejected rather than silently misread.
